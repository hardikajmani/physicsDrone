# Quadcopter
This the arduino code for bluetooth controlled quadcopter project

This is the code for controlling a quadcopter using an arduino command prompt application in phone connected to arduino via bluetooth using bluetooth module.
 * Presently using this we code can switch on,off,increase and decrease the speed of all motors together.
 * conditions given here are:-
                    'o' for on
                    'a' for off
                    'u' to increase the speed
                    'd' to decrease the speed
 * There is a buzzer over here which will ring whenever the 'on' or 'off' command is sent.
 * It will also ring whenever the quadcopter has reached its max or min limit.
 
 *Here is a picture and a video of the project.
